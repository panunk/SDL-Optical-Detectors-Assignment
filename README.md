# SDL-Optical-Detectors-Assignment
Space Detector Lab Optical Detectors Assignment

Assignment: Create a python script that can take multiple HST images and chart their stars on an H-R Diagram. 

WARNING:
To successfully run my code, you MUST have all six data files (three each for F336W and F555W) AND the ccd_utils.py 
code in the SAME directory as my code. My code is not Dora the Explorer, it will not be able to find files in sub-folders. 

SECOND WARNING: curve_fit keeps crashing my code and I still can't find out why, sorry
